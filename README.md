# DATA-SECURITY
In this project, our primary objective was to protect data from unauthorized access. To address this challenge, I utilized a machine learning algorithm—Support Vector Machines (SVM)—to determine whether the data was secure or not.

This was a collaborative project involving a team of four members: a cybersecurity specialist, a full-stack developer, and two machine learning engineers. My role in the project was to develop the machine learning model and handle the coding tasks related to it.

The project outcome demonstrated whether the data was secure or not. The cybersecurity aspect involved implementing encryption and decryption techniques to enhance data security, while the SVM model was used to assess the security status of the data
